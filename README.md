# LSTMvsGRU
In this project, I have used 3 layer LSTM and GRU models. 
Through this model, I ran the same dataset on the same number of layers of both GRU and LSTM
This was done to compare their level of accuracies and loss.
2 Versions of these models were used. 
Difference between models is the output ldimension of the embedding layer.
It is usually suggested that the range of values for this layer should be between 100-300, that is why i took 2 values, <100 and >100.
imdb Dataset that comes along with keras was used.
