# LSTMvsGRU
In this project, I have used 3 layer LSTM and GRU models. 2 Versions of these models were used. 
Difference between models is the output ldimension of the embedding layer.
It is usually suggested that the range of values for this layer should be between 100-300, that is why i took 2 values, <100 and >100.
imdb Dataset that comes along with keras was used.
